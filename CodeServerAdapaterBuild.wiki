#summary Build commands.


== Install ==

First checkout form repository {{{adapter-services}}}:

{{{$ git clone https://code.google.com/p/sll-rtjp.adapter-services/}}}

Then run from from top directory (sll-rtjp.adapter-services).

{{{$ mvn [clean] install}}}

== Run embedded container and database  ==

from codeserveradapter/codeserveradapter-app

{{{$ mvn -PmuleServer}}}

== Get WSDL for Web Service {{{ListPaymentResponsible}}} ==

Open a browser and navigate to:

{{{http://localhost:20000/codeserveradapter/services/payment-responsible/v1?wsdl}}}

== Override configuration parameters ==

Create a local file named {{{.codeserveradapter-config.properties}}} in your home directory (don't omit the first dot ".").

Add your own settings, like:
#
{{{pr.indexFile=/tmp/hsa-index-1.gz}}}
{{{pr.ftp.cron = 0 0/5 * * * ?}}}

 
== Format source file headers == 

In order to succeed with a build all source files must have an appropriate file header (see /LICENSE.txt), and there's a plugin to fix this automatically.
 
from directory {{{codeserveradapter}}} run

{{{$ mvn license:format}}}
