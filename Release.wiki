#summary Building a new release version

= Introduction =

Usage of maven and git to release a stable version


= Details =

From your develop branch run

1. mvn jgitflow:release-start -DreleaseVersion=%version_to_be_released%

2. mvn jgitflow:release-finish -DnoDeploy=true (noDeploy is set to true since we don't use Nexus)
Here you will be asked about the next version for the development branch. Increment the build version number and don't forget to suffix SNAPSHOT example 2.1-SNAPSHOT

3. Push your changes > git push
