#summary Building a new release version

= Introduction =

Usage of maven and git to release a stable version. The Git model is adapted from http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

Note: When creating a release from develop a auto merge is done to master branch by JGit plugin and the virtual release branch is then removed. All is handled by the JGit plugin on following the steps below.

= Details =

From your develop branch run (don't forget git pull is not updated)

1. git checkout develop

2. git pull origin develop

3. {{{mvn jgitflow:release-start -DreleaseVersion=<version_to_be_released>}}}

4. {{{mvn jgitflow:release-finish -DnoDeploy=true}}} (noDeploy is set to true since we don't use Nexus)
Here you will be asked about the next version for the development branch. Increment the build version number and don't forget to suffix SNAPSHOT example 2.1-SNAPSHOT

5. git push (Push your changes)

6. git push --tags
